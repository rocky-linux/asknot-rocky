# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to asknot-rocky! This project is built with Next.js using TypeScript, leverages the App Router, and styles with TailwindCSS. We also use components from shadcn/ui to keep our UI sleek and functional. Below is a guide to help you get started with your contributions.

**Prerequisites**

Before contributing, ensure you have a basic understanding of the following:

* **Next.js:** Familiarity with Next.js and its core principles is crucial as our website relies on this framework.
* **TypeScript:** All code should be written in TypeScript.
* **TailwindCSS:** Styles should be implemented using TailwindCSS.
* **Git:** Knowledge of Git workflows is essential since all our code management is done through Git.

**Development Environment**

1. **Fork and Clone:** Start by forking the repository and then cloning your fork locally.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. **Branch:** Always create a new branch from `develop` for your work. The `develop` branch is our main development branch, and all PRs should target this branch.

**Issue-Driven Development**

* **Find or Create an Issue:** Before starting work on a change, please search for an existing issue.  If no issue addresses your proposed changes, create a new issue to document the problem or potential enhancement.
* **Link Your PR:** When you open your pull request, clearly link it to the associated issue. This helps maintainers understand the context of your changes.

**Coding Guidelines**

* **Code Style:** Pay attention to ESLint warnings. Your pull requests should not introduce any new ESLint warnings. If you encounter warnings in areas you are not working on, consider fixing them.
* **Components:** Utilize existing UI components from shadcn/ui where possible. If you need to create new components, ensure they are reusable and well-documented.
* **TypeScript Usage:** Make sure to use TypeScript effectively to maintain type safety across the application.

**Adding Images**

* **Location:** All images should be placed in the `public/images` directory. Please categorize images by their purpose; for example, images for news posts should be placed in `public/images/news`.
* **Optimization:** Ensure that images are optimized for the web to enhance performance and reduce load times.

**Translation Contributions**

Currently, we are not accepting contributions for translations as the marketing copy has not been finalized. Please refrain from submitting translation updates at this time.

**Pull Request Process**

1. **Pull Request:** Once you are ready, open a pull request against the `develop` branch. Ensure that your PR title and description clearly describe the changes, and **reference the associated issue number (e.g., "Fixes #123")**.
2. **Review:** Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers. Be responsive to feedback and make necessary adjustments based on the review.
3. **Merge:** Once your PR is approved and passes all checks, a maintainer will merge it into the `develop` branch.

**Testing**

Before submitting your pull request, ensure that all existing tests pass and add new tests if you are introducing new features or significant changes.
